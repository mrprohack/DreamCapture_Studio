## Introduction

This project allows you to train a LORA model on your images using the DreamBooth AI tool with minimal effort. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can quickly set up and start the training process.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with AutoTrain DreamBooth:

### 1. Upload Images

Place the images you want to use for training in the `images/` folder. Make sure your images are appropriately labeled and organized for the best results.

### 2. Define Prompt

Create a unique and specific prompt that describes the task or concept you want the LORA model to learn. The quality of your prompt will greatly affect the output of your trained model, so make it as precise as possible.

### 3. Open Telegram

Find "DreamCapture_Studio_bot" on Telegram by visiting [this link](https://t.me/DreamCapture_Studio_bot) and start a chat with the bot.

### 4. Get Target User ID

The bot will reply with the target_user_id. You'll need this user ID to interact with the bot programmatically.

## Running Your Project

Execute the code cells in Colab by using `Runtime > Run all` or individual cells in your Colab environment. This will initiate the training process using your images and the defined prompt.
